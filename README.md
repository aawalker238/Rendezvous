This web application is an event planning application built using React, Redux, and Firebase. 
The application allows users to join in order to create or attend events or choose rather to be a casual user who simply browses events.

Possible new future features include:
1. Event Streaming
2. Chat functionality
3. Site and/or email notifications when new events are coming near the user or other messages.
